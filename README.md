# Use-case-diagram_Gov-service-app
The UML Use Case diagram of the government service application. 

## Short description of the app

Digital Portal of the Ministry of Happiness. Citizens can apply for state support and authenticate using E-signature or BankID. Once logged into the system, users can submit applications for state support, track their application status, and receive automatic status notifications.

For retired citizens, the system automatically increases the amount of state support. Additionally, premium users have access to exclusive features, including applying for preferential business programs and receiving consultations via a chatbot.

This project serves as an example of how a UML User Case diagram can be constructed. This type of diagram plays a key role in developing a new product and improving an existing one.
